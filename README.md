- Hey everyone -- I go by Spitball (the name without the hyphen was taken), and I'm fairly new to programming. 

- I have some prior experience in Python & webscraping, HTML, and Javascript (very limited) -- but I'm looking to grow my knowledge base!

- Iâ€™m currently using HackThisSite to learn some penetration testing, and always looking for useful resources and explanations of concepts!
